abstract = {Summary R graphics has provided the ability to draw simple text labels on plots since R version 1.0.0. However, these basic text-drawing facilities are quite limited. Over the past 25 years, more sophisticated text-drawing features have been added: support for the Unicode character set; access to system fonts; text paths; support for text markup; and rendering of typeset text. This article charts the development of text-drawing support in R and provides demonstrations of some of the more sophisticated features.}

title = {Data Visualisation with {R}: 100 Examples},
year = {2017},
isbn = {3319497502},
publisher = {Springer Publishing Company, Incorporated},
edition = {1st},
abstract = {This book introduces readers to the fundamentals of creating presentation graphics using R, based on 100 detailed and complete scripts. It shows how bar and column charts, population pyramids, Lorenz curves, box plots, scatter plots, time series, radial polygons, Gantt charts, heat maps, bump charts, mosaic and balloon charts, and a series of different thematic map types can be created using Rs Base Graphics System. Every example uses real data and includes step-by-step explanations of the figures and their programming. The open source software R is an established standard and a powerful tool for various visualizing applications, integrating nearly all technologies relevant for data visualization. The basic software, enhanced by more than 7000 extension packs currently freely available, is intensively used by organizations including Google, Facebook and the CIA. The book serves as a comprehensive reference guide to a broad variety of applications in various fields. This book is intended for all kinds of R users, ranging from experts, for whom especially the example codes are particularly useful, to beginners, who will find the finished graphics most helpful in learning what R can actually deliver.},
