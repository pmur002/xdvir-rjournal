Dear Professor Hurley,
\bigskip

Please consider the article titled "Rendering LaTeX in R" for publication in the
R Journal.

The manuscript introduces a new package called `xdvir` which allows users to
render LaTeX fragments in R plots, including labels and data symbols for
`ggplot2` plots.

I believe the readers of the R Journal will find this article helpful for their
work because it provides access to the sophisticated typesetting capabilities of
LaTeX for drawing text labels and annotations on R plots, for example the
ability to render high-quality mathematical equations.

NOTE: The font TeX Gyre Adventor (regular) 
[(https://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/tex-gyre/adventor)](https://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/tex-gyre/adventor)
will need to be installed in order to build this article.
