+ Preflight Checklist for New Submissions
  (from [logged in] https://arxiv.org/user/)

  AND NOTE that the online version has links to helpful tips and advice!!!

  + If your submission is written in TeX you must upload your source. PDFs
    produced from TeX may be declined. Learn more about why TeX source is
    required

  + Experienced authors recommend putting all the files you will upload into one
    folder before starting. Read how one author prepares a clean upload

  + Common errors that slow down announcement include missing files or
    references. Double check for missing content before uploading. Learn more
    about common mistakes

  + All announced content is archival and cannot be removed. Make sure that data
    you do not want archived is not part of your upload, for example TeX
    comments in your source. Read more tips from an arXiv author
